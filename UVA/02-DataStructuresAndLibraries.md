#### Bit Operation of Traversal Set 

　Suppose we use each binary bit to represent an set element,we now need to traverse all the subsets and print the them. We have two strategies, one is bit-by-bit checking, and the other is skip checking using `loWbit(x)` operations.

```c++
//枚举排列组合,复杂度O(n!)
next_permutation(a,a+n);
prev_premutation(a,a+n);
```

```c++

```
